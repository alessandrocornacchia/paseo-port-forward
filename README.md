# paseo-port-forward

A Paseo plugin that adds a **Ports** screen and forwards ports open on a remote Paseo host to your laptop's `localhost`, similar to VS Code Remote's port forwarding.

The plugin runs only on your laptop's Paseo daemon. It reaches remote hosts over your own SSH connection, so it also works for hosts you connect to through the Paseo relay. Nothing is installed on the remote; a read-only scan script runs there over SSH.

## Setup

1. Install the plugin on the **laptop** daemon:
   ```bash
   paseo plugin install /path/to/paseo-port-forward
   ```
2. Open **Ports** from the sidebar (or the command center, "Open Ports").
3. Pick a remote host and enter its SSH target: `user@host` or an alias from `~/.ssh/config`. **Test connection** checks that the machine you reach is the same Paseo host (its `~/.paseo/paseo.pid` `serverId` must match).
4. Press **Forward** on a port. It is served on `http://localhost:<port>`, or the next free port when that one is taken locally.

Settings → Plugins → **Port forwarding** has the SSH targets, auto-forward, the ignore list and the auto-forward poll interval.

Requirements:
- Paseo `>=0.11.1`.
- A macOS or Linux laptop with OpenSSH.
- Linux remotes.
- Key- or agent-based SSH. `BatchMode=yes` is used, so password prompts and unknown host keys fail with an error instead of hanging. Connect once by hand to accept a new host key.

## How it works

```
Laptop daemon
└─ plugin backend (Node)
   ├─ one ssh ControlMaster per remote host  (ssh -M -S /tmp/paseo-pf-<uid>/<hash>.sock -N <target>)
   ├─ scan: `sh -s` over the master every ~2 s while the screen is open
   └─ forwards: ssh -S <sock> -O forward|cancel -L 127.0.0.1:<lport>:<host>:<rport>
```

- **Detection** reads `/proc/net/tcp{,6}` for `LISTEN` sockets and maps socket inodes to pids through `/proc/<pid>/fd`. It keeps only processes descending from the Paseo supervisor in `~/.paseo/paseo.pid`. It drops:
  - the supervisor and the daemon worker;
  - the daemon's listen port;
  - Paseo's own helpers (terminal worker, esbuild);
  - anything under a plugin-host process.

  Each port carries the process, command line, `PASEO_AGENT_ID` and `PASEO_AGENT_CWD` from its environment. Terminal processes have no agent id and show their working directory instead.
- **Forwarding** binds locally to `127.0.0.1` only. Wildcard and loopback remote binds connect to `127.0.0.1` (IPv4) or `localhost` (`::`). Specific addresses are used as-is.
- **Auto-forward** forwards every new port on every host with an SSH target, minus the ignore list (default `22, 5432, 6379`). It removes the forward when the remote port closes. Manual forwards are kept and shown as "closed on remote" until you stop them.
- **Reconnect:** if the master dies, it reconnects with backoff (1 s up to 30 s) and reapplies the forwards on the same local ports.
- **Cleanup:**
  - Disabling or reloading the plugin cancels all forwards and closes the masters.
  - Each master runs under a small `sh` watchdog that kills it when the plugin process's pipe closes, so a crashed or SIGKILLed plugin leaves no `ssh`, socket or local listener behind.
  - Stale control sockets are swept on start.
- **Idle:** a master with no forwards closes after 2 minutes without the screen polling it.

## Phase 0 findings (Paseo 0.11.1)

The plan in issue #1 assumed a workspace-panel tab. These are the answers to its open questions, read from the app bundle and checked against the running daemon:

1. **RPC routing.** `useRpc` goes to the daemon of the host the plugin is installed on. Each installed plugin's client runtime is created per host (`byHost`, keyed by `serverId`), and its `invoke` calls that host's `invokePluginRpc`. `PaseoApi` (`getPaseoClient`) exposes no plugin RPC, so there is no supported way to call this plugin's backend from a UI that belongs to another host.
2. **Panels on other hosts.** No. Workspace panels are only offered for plugins whose `serverId` equals the workspace's host, so a laptop-only plugin never shows a tab in a remote workspace. That is why the UI is a laptop-host **screen plus sidebar item** that covers every remote host (`useHosts()`), instead of a per-workspace tab.
3. **Local daemon.** The plugin needs a daemon on the laptop to run its backend; the Ports screen only appears when one is connected.
4. **Opening URLs.** `navigation.openBrowser` needs a `workspaceId`, which a global screen doesn't have. **Open** uses `openExternalUrl` instead. The forwarded URL is on the laptop's localhost either way.

Agent titles come from `getPaseoClient(serverId).agents.list()`, best effort. Workspace scoping isn't implemented, because a global screen has no selected workspace.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

`server/fixtures/linux-scan.txt` is real scan output from a Linux container running Paseo 0.11.1, with a terminal-started server, an agent-tagged server, and an unrelated server that must be excluded.

## Limitations

- Linux remotes only. macOS remotes would need `lsof` (planned).
- Windows laptops are not supported: Windows OpenSSH has no ControlMaster.
- No workspace tab (see Phase 0 above).
- No password or interactive SSH authentication.
